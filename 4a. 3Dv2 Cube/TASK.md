On coming back as revision, the previous chapter on 3D, didn't really cut the musturd in terms of getting to grips with viewing & rotating a genuine 3D object.
Issues left unlcear included clipping, perspective, importance of `w` in the vec4 transformations.

Try again :

1. Use a triangle strip, and if necessary an element index, to describe a 3D rectangle.
2. Assign solid unique colours to each of the 6 faces.
3. Move and rotate the object as a trig function of time

Q. What parameter is our perspective? What does it mean in real life?
Q. Where is the camera?
Q. Are we clear what the `w` arg does?
