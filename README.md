# helloWebGL
A specific extension that is beyond the scope of helloParallelism, to explore the opportunities with WebGL for parallel general purpose programming, SIMD, and rendering techniques.

## TBC
* Textures to store data between iterations
* 2D
* 3D
* Shaders for General Purpose Computing - Hardware specific?

This looks good :

# Approach
- Follow the above tutorial to get a few examples up and running
- Set some increasingly less trivial tasks / challenges to take us towards more relevant topics
- Mandlebrot set
- Complex analysis render
- Particle sim
- Fluids
